# The Trudge

You don't feel like moving. You several times per day wish a bed would unfold on the sidewalk in front of you so that you could sleep in it. You'd cover your head with the pillow, sink your consciousness deep into the fluff, and drown out all recollection of everything.

But that doesn't happen, so you keep trudging, leg movement after leg movement. Each body part a lethargic, cynical student who doesn't want to do anything but will begrudgingly comply, very slowly, if you sit there and force. 

Your brain, the taskmaster, doesn't want to be there either. Everybody in the classroom is cross with each other, and fed up with this futile situation that won't go away.

Eventually you trudge to the end of your trudging and you do find a bed and you close your eyes hoping tomorrow'll be different, but you don't expect much.
